# Compatible keyboards

This list is by no means complete. If you have a keyboard with a compatible MCU chances are that you can port QMK for it. 

Keep in mind that in the recent years, several manufacturers started to change the MCU inside their keyboards to cheaper alternatives amid the chip shortages.
It is a possibility that even though your keyboard is listed here is it **not** guaranteed that is compatible with this project.
